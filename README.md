# Project Setup Guide

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine.

---

## 1. Clone the Repository

Replace `<repo-link>` with the actual repository link.

```bash
git clone <repo-link>
cd <repo-folder>
```

---

## 2. Initialize Git (if not already initialized)

If the project is **not cloned** and you are starting fresh, initialize Git manually:

```bash
git init
```

---

## 3. Initialize PNPM

If PNPM is not yet initialized in the project folder, run:

```bash
pnpm init
```

---

## 4. Install Dependencies

To install all required packages, simply run:

```bash
pnpm install
```

---

## 5. Verify Setup

You can check if everything is installed correctly by running:

```bash
pnpm -v
git --version
```

---

âœ… Your project is now ready to use!
